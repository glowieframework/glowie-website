### Installing Glowie

This will create a new Glowie application inside `myapp` folder.

That's all. Incredible and simple, isn't it?

### Updating from an earlier version
Updating Glowie is as simple as installing it. Just navigate to your application directory and run:

```plaintext
composer update
```

This will update Glowie core modules to the latest version available.
