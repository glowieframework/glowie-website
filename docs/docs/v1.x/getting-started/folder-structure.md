# Folder structure

[toc]

### Basic folder structure
A Glowie application is bundled with two main folders: `app` and `vendor` along with some server configuration files in the root folder.

You only need to **point your server to this root directory** and Glowie will do the rest for you.

Here you will understand what every folder means and how your application is structured.

### App folder
The `app` folder has everything related to your application. The folders within this folder are:

**commands**
Application CLI commands.

**config**
Your application configuration and routing files.

**controllers**
Application controllers.

**languages**
Application internationalization files.

**middlewares**
Application middlewares.

**migrations**
Application database migrations.

**models**
Application database models.

**public**
Application public accessible folder. All your application assets and public frontend files must be stored here.

**storage**
Application cache, logs and temporary files. This folder and its children **must have writing permissions**.

**views**
All your application views, layouts and helpers.

### Vendor folder
The `vendor` folder is generated by Composer and stores everything related to your application dependencies and Glowie core modules. We do not recommend editing anything in this folder, since files will be changed if you update Glowie or any dependencies from your application.
